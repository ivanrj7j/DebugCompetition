    """
    Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is 
    equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

    The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
    You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division division.

    Examples:
    Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
    Output: [24,12,8,6]

    Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
    Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
