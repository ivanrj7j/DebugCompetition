# 🐛 Python Bug-Fixing Competition

Welcome to the **Python Bug-Fixing Competition** organized by **ENCIDE MACE**!

You will find **10 Python files** in the `problems/` directory. Each file contains a function designed to solve a specific programming problem. However, **every solution contains both syntax errors (which prevent the code from running) and logical errors (which produce incorrect results).**

Your task is to fix all the bugs so that the code runs correctly and passes all the test cases.

## Before submitting

1. Update the **README.md** with your:

   * NANDHANA N P 
   * nandhanapradeep006@gmail.com
   * 8129898282

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Open this repository on GitHub.
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner of the page.

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

Clone **your forked repository** to your local computer:

```bash
git clone <YOUR_FORKED_REPOSITORY_URL>
cd DebugCompetition
```

### Step 3: Set Up Your Python Environment

Ensure Python 3 is installed:

```bash
python --version
```

*(On macOS/Linux, you may need to use `python3`.)*

Creating a virtual environment is optional but recommended:

```bash
python -m venv venv

# Windows PowerShell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Windows Command Prompt
.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 4: Test Your Solutions

Run all tests:

```bash
python run_tests.py
```

Run a specific problem:

```bash
python run_test.py 3
```

Or run interactively:

```bash
python run_test.py
```

## 🛠 Competition Rules

There are **10 files** inside the `problems/` directory.

* Read the docstring in each file for the problem statement.
* Fix both syntax and logical errors.
* **Do not change function names or parameters**, as they are used for automatic grading.

## 📤 Submitting Your Work

Before submitting:

1. Update the **README.md** with your:

   * NANDHANA NP
   * nandhanapradeep006@gmail.com
   * 8129898282

Then submit your solution:

```bash
git add .

git push origin main
```

Create a **Pull Request** from your fork to the main repository. The Pull Request title **must be your full name**.

A GitHub Action will automatically run the test suite and calculate your score.
